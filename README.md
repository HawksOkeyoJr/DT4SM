# Digital Thread for Smart Manufacturing (DT4SM)

## Project Overview

We live in a new manufacturing era that has been called the Third Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by the digitization of manufacturing and the increased use of data. In this era, digital information plays a central role. How the product’s design and manufacturing information is authored, exchanged, and processed will determine who will succeed in this era. The "digital thread" that integrates and drives modern design, manufacturing, and product-support processes can be exploited to reduce cycle time and achieve first pass success.  Moreover, it is the only feasible way to deal with the complexity of today’s products. A "bi-directional" digital thread, based on emerging, open standards, will raise the competitiveness of small-to-medium, U.S. manufacturing enterprises. These standards provide 3D-geometric models enhanced with product and manufacturing information that is semantically rich and machine readable. Yet the digital thread flows in one direction only currently, and gaps in the thread prevent enterprise-wide utilization of information. This project will conduct research to 1) identify the required communications and their information content, 2) formalize and promulgate descriptions of those requirements, and 3) support development of tools and standards for the exchange and use of that information. The results of this project will accelerate the design-to-production timeline and, more importantly, at reduced costs.
