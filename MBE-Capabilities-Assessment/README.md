# Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Capabilities Assessment
The information below provides a basic level of documentation for the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Capabilities Assessment guidebook activities. For support or more information, please contact Thomas Hedberg (thomas.hedberg@nist.gov).

## What is the MBE Capabilities Assessment
The MBE Capabilities Assessment is a tool developed the U.S. Department of Defense to assist in assessing the capability level of an organization implementing MBE practices and methods. The tool was created Microsoft Excel and helps organizations assess MBE capabilities in the following areas:
- Design activities
- Change management and data management activities
- Manufacturing planning activities
- Quality requirements and planning activities
- Miscellaneous activities

## MBE Capabilities Assessment Workshop
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a "Model-Based Enterprise Summit" from April 12-14, 2016 with the intention of identifying challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in manufacturing and quality assurance where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in the product's lifecycle. This 3D model is considered a model-based definition (MBD) and acts as a "digital thread" of sorts to weave and link all the phases of the product lifecycle together. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and NIST developed a tool to help organizations assess whether they are ready for an MBE or smart manufacturing platform. The tool was appropriately named: "MBE Capability Index Assessment Tool." As part of the summit, NIST was also interested in collecting input specific to the MBE Capability Index Assessment Tool and the consideration for developing a guidebook for the tool. 

The workshop report is available for free download at: [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.100-1](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AMS.100-1).

## Repository Description

This GitHub repository is a collection of tools developed for Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Capabilities Assessment activities. The project is currently developing several tools for use in the project's research. Those tools will be published to this repository once they reach a baseline level of maturity. Below is an overview of the tools currently available in this repository.
